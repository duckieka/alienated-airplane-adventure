^i followed along the video lololol, so yea 

how to play:
1. have visual studio code downloaded
2. download the live server extension 
3. copy the code into vs code/upload files into there
4. start the liver server port
5. it should automatically open up a window with the game
6. yay have fun
7. dont look at the code until you've played it a few times to avoid getting spoiled :D
